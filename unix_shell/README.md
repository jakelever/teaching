# Unix Shell

This is the introductory lesson to the Unix Shell. It is estimated to take X hours.

The basic syllabus is based on the [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org) [Unix Shell Lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)

## Requirements

- A Bash environment
- Downloading the associated lesson files (insert link here)

## Introduction

You are a digital forensics expert. 
The mayor of TOWNNAME has gone missing. 
The police suspect that the contents of his laptop may reveal what happened to him.
Using Bash, you are going to solve this mystery.

## The Files

If you haven't already, download the forensics files. Extract them to your Desktop and open a terminal window.

## Plan
- cd, ls & cat - moving around and reading READMEs to find appropriate files
- cp, mv, mkdir & rm - ???
- sh - do it early (let's create silly scripts with idiot requirements like they need the file to be in the same directory, and they need the analysis folder to be deleted, or they need a folder created)
- wc & sort - find who he emailed the most
- shell script - ???
- grep - find a password
- for loop - iterate over encrypted attachments
- find - a specific email or attachment

## Basic Syllabus from Software Carpentry
- Introducing the Shell
- Navigating Files and Directories
- Working with Files and Directories
- Pipes and Filters
